glibc 2.37 with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 on embedded platforms
lseek(fd, -4, SEEK_CUR) does not move cursor without returning -1.
Subsequent writes then can create 4GB files due to internal overflow.
man lseek does not specify this awkward behavior on negative offsets with SEEK_CUR.
solution: keep track of current absolute position and use SEEK_SET.
