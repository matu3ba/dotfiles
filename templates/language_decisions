Confession of pricing man
* some consumers use price as indicator of product's quality
  => higher price => higher quality
* also occurs in b2b
  => larger companies think price too low
* strategic financial decisions may require high baseline to be deemed worth being looked at
  => part of paying high price is to shift blame, if something goes wrong
  => may access risk vs benefit only from cost point
* may summarize decisions as efficient, because has no (technical) knowledge to quantify technological decisions
