string interpolation
println "The time is ${new Date().getTime()}"


String Interpolation
Within a GString you can use $ without {} to evaluate a property path, e.g.
def date = new Date()
println "The time is $date.time"
If you want to evaluate an expression which is more complex than a property path, you must use ${}, e.g.
println "The time is ${new Date().getTime()}"
Dynamic Code Execution
Dynamically accessing a property
def prop = "time"
new Date()."$prop"
Dynamically invoking a method
def prop = "toString"
new Date()."$prop"()
As pointed out in the comments this is really just a special case of string interpolation, because the following is also valid
new Date().'toString'()
