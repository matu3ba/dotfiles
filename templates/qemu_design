* thread implementation very wonky and tricky to understand according to nyx author(s)

====attack_vectors
* reasonable secure implementation:
  - accept certain timing side channels
  - neglect hardware defects [no secrets on VM and VM should be reset]
  - resulting slowdown: 10x
* qemu as unreasonable secure but fast implementation:
  - emulator and paravirtualization hybrid
  - mapping to native devices to get acceptable dispatch rate (timing, perf)
  - cheat and JIT for performance
  - resulting slowdown: 2.?x
