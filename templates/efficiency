* TODO process efficiency rules
* TODO how to design in such a way that you avoid harmful radio-emissions
* cost: PIC better for low quantity, or STM for high quantity
* STM offers better development tools in terms of IDE support, HAL, and libraries
* assume: development and manufacturing in the West costs a lot more, sells slowly
* go for steady small orders, share sales forecast
* offer more money to get things faster
* consolidate suppliers for better negotiation power
* resort to second-hand component distributors
* consider a PCB design that allows for 2 or more alternatives for "dangerous"
positions
* tooling
  - review CAD models with 1 SolidWorks, 2 Fusion 360 with multiple team members editing
  - simulate designs digitally with 1 Ansys 2 COMSOL
  - projet tracking jira, monday.com, etc
  - rapid prototyping with 3erp for hands-on insight within hours
  - communication zoom, miro, slack
  - Collaborative DFM
  - https://titoma.com/blog/collaborative-hardware-development/
  - Real-time dashboards and version control prevents duplication, confusion, keeping everyone aligned and informed

====cost efficiency
1. NDA
2. Development in copyright abiding market
3. Own full IP
Many IP problems we have seen arise when development or tooling was offered
free or far below cost, and the client’s sales numbers did not meet rosy
forecasts. Since the client was not able to sell, the manufacturer feels
morally justified in making back his investment by doing the selling himself.
4. Divide and Conquer
allocate PCB assembly, molding, and final assembly to different factories
5. off-the-shelf solutions (for hardware), involve factory suggested components early on
6. same need, same solution
7. material up to 60% costs (of hardware)
8. remove or no undesired features, reduce complexity
9. trust-based relationships with suppliers
10. try to find bargains (as short-term solution)
11. eletronics:
  * try to integrate components on same side of printed boards
  * standard size -> dont design enclosure yourself
  * reduce BOM cost
  * start with factory ASAP after first BOM so they see and validate component selection
  * purchase 10 or more competitor products and learn from their design decision,
  architecture, materials, etc. competitive benchmarking is good way to find solutions
  to reduce your production cost and understand what competitor does
  * call on hardware experts, because designing most affordable PCB needs lots
  of expertise

====dev efficiency
* TalonVoice & Cursorless for speach based editing

  - in-editor debugging, time travel debugging and value explorer
  - fast test execution: calculates and runs the absolute minimum set of tests affected by your code changes
  - ai support: MCP server and tools give AI agents live access to test results, runtime values, execution paths, coverage, and dependencies
  - live runtime vars: see results next to code
  - inline error and code coverage: error messages, gutter indicators for failing execution paths, editor cmds + shortcuts for navigation
  - inline code coverage: while execution update of test coverage, editor cmds + shortcuts for navigation
  - selective test running: smart and exclusive test runs
  - deep object inspection: complex data structures as expandable tree view with info for origin of values, Interactive Value Graphs
  - interactive test output: failing tests listed with hyperlink, errors, diffs/snapshots, error stacks, console.log calls
  - test execution viewer: inspect code test is executing in single logical view (without having to jump between multiple fns and files)
  - perf profiling: test CPU usage profile including external dependencies with navigation of results
  - diff & snapshot management: expected vs actual as compact diff, snapshot update available
  - practical insight: overview of tests and code coverage sorted by name, duration, pass/fail, coverage
  - no vendor, API or framework lock-in
