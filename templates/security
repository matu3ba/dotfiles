CASR: Crash Analysis and Severity Report
AFL: Fuzzing crashes

====basics

Micro-Kernel: Nothing enabled on default with user needing to setup things.
Mono/Uni-Kernel: Most things enabled on default with user needing to disable things.
Design of Uni-Kernel alone makes less unsecure due to less isolation of components.

Note: Linux is becoming more Micro-Kernel-like with io_uring as 0-copy messaging,
bpf as VM running statically compiled code inside Linux etc.
RFC 9669 BPF Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Proof code effort is quadratic to code size:
* Bug hidden for any non-trivial or verified implementation.
* Use the simplest approach possible, isolate components
* If unfeasible to rule out intruders, you must monitor and mitigate including
  all related costs.
* Plan for the worst case

=> seL4 would be ideal to use, but maybe there is a tradeoff to allow some
more monitoring or control on the host system ie to debug the VM?
=> Push-Button (SMT) technique:
   * specify correctness condition
   * state exploration tool
   * only proves simple properties
=> Model checking
   * simple model of system for exhaustively search state space,
   * more limited than SMT
=> Framework Microkit for minimal abstractions => Lions OS (optimized for 1 specific use case)
=> Pancake used in seL4, which is the imperative part of CakeML.
   * C-like but safer
   * written in CakeML
Unclear: Verification of linker + linker speak (object format)?

Timing channels in protocols are a huge problem
* using wireguard instead of openVPN to run ssh over it does not eliminate the
  timing channel
* must analyze frequencies, meaning plot a few dimensions against time, like
  packet size, length on router level for whatever tool you are suspicious off.
* Interact and try to identify differences (patterns etc).

idea examples or tools to for time analysis (io, network etc)

====general
Incomplete list of intrusion prevention and detection:
* login policy
* least privilege (network services non-privileged)
* chroot jails or containers for network services
* secured web content, encrypted authentication etc
* fast patching
* SELinux or Apparmor in enforcing mode
* Tripwire or other intrusion detection software and schemes to detect changes to critical files.
* rootkit detection scanners periodically
* strict firewall rules, port forwarding etc
* correct file permissions
* secure backup copies of system software and data
  for example using https://www.tarsnap.com/index.html
* sys bootstrapping from local storage until hardening applied
* write down attack vectors and plan etc

====applied_basics

basics https://phoenixnap.com/kb/server-security-tips

====jail

Linux
1. wireguard + ssh (on another port)
  * (dynamic) port forwarding and all those things
  * TODO
2. sandboxed environment (jails, zones, containers)
  * seccomp (whitelist of Kernel calls)
  * file system overlay
  * ulimit or cgroups pendant
  * landlock (Kernel object access)
  * network access removed (routing, connection interfaces etc)
  * cpu, io, memory limits
  * max. execution time
  * no clipboard access etc
  * no login manager entry
  * cgroups, apparmor, selinux needed?
  * paging (disable Kernel Samepage Merging)
  * Kernel config https://www.timesys.com/security/securing-your-linux-configuration-kernel-hardening/
3. unprivileged user
4. coredump + stack trace obtainable,
5. reaper pid to kill child processes
6. restricting ptrace to only 1 process required selinux policy
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-notebook
- unclear security integrity checks in overview
https://serverfault.com/questions/933205/selinux-policy-for-cap-sys-ptrace-by-invoking-process-name,
but should work now in landlock:
https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#ptrace-restrictions
"To be allowed to use ptrace(2) and related syscalls on a target
process, a sandboxed process should have a subset of the target process rules,
which means the tracee must be in a sub-domain of the tracer."
Unfortunately it does not say "must have".
7. disable hyperthreading (in bios)
8. hardened kernel?
9. good practical usage https://blog.emilua.org/2025/01/12/software-sandboxing-basics/

====virtualization

Note: Without kvm qemu is very slow and with kvm qemu has a huge attack surface
from the guest OS.

* qemu qmp (or use qemus gdb stub) to read the vm's memory
* attach serial channel to qemu machine and write stuff to that (treat the read bytes as plain and potentially malicious data)

====allocators

Preventing Use-After-Free Attacks with Fast Forward Allocation
* overhead in runtime perf vs glibc
  + allegedly ~2.3% for one-time allocations
  + up to 35% due to mmap-sem lock in Linux kernel
  + ~60% memory overhead
  + nginx testing with comparable throughput
* lesson: One-time-allocation effective + simple to implement

====html
* could use HTTP/1.1, mandate pipelining and TLS 1.2 to get most advantages without the drawbacks
* multiplexing bad idea unless server has logic for fair scheduling (usually has not) and opens door for denial of service
* too complex, useless freedom of choice
* HTTP/1.1 drawbacks from https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-http-2-work/
  - head of line blocking, solution: server implements pipelining, bad: rely on time behavior (better protocols exist)
  - congestion window adjusting for handling many domains, solution: do scheduling yourself, bad: externalize as attack vector
  - header data duplication due to being stateless, solution: better defaults, bad: save more state for compression
  - there is no formal model (state automaton) of HTTP2.0, not even from the client

====virtual_machine
Windows User Space Emulator - https://github.com/momo5502/emulator/

====state_stateless_splitting
* handling non-software state
  - hardware (for drivers etc)
* stateful components
  - reset communication channels
  - restarting component
* stateless components
* No crash if, 1. no need, failure not caused 2. by component state (hw) or 3.
  erroneous state (correct states causes fault), 4. critical state, 5.
  erroneous state persistent
* persistent failures (heuristics): restart count, increase restart domain, sanitise
  persistent state, reinstall, revert, update component code, give up

* Breaking Bitlocker - Bypassing the Windows Disk Encryption
https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/dram-emfi.html
* with soldering a fire lighter is sufficient to get root
* unclear how ECC affects this

====encryption
* authentication/trust usability only given with
  + SCRAM (only protects you for the 2nd-nth connections, the password still needs to be provided the first time)
  + main alternative is to use an out of band channel to communicate trust, for example
    OTP with ideally OCRA or TOTP or HOTP or something given by humans

====hashing
https://orlp.net/blog/breaking-hash-functions/
breaking hashing
* for universal hashing it was proven that it can not be broken with inversion
* Pre-image resistance. For some constant cc it should be hard to find some input mm such that h(m)=ch(m)=c.
* Second pre-image resistance. For some input m_1 it should be hard to find another input m_2 such that h(m_1)=h(m_2).
* Collision resistance. It should be hard to find inputs m_1,m_2 such that h(m_1)=h(m_2).
* Inversion
  o x += y => x -= y
  o x *= c => (modular multiplicate inverse of C) c * c^{-1} = 1 (mod m)
def egcd(a, b):
    if a == 0: return (b, 0, 1)
    g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)
    return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)
def modinv(c, m):
    g, x, y = egcd(c, m)
    assert g == 1, "c, m must be coprime"
    return x % m
  o x ^= y => x ^= y
  o bit shift can not be inverted (easily) unless 1. bit rotation by const, 2. "xorshift"
1.
abcdef -> (x >> k) | (x << (w-k)), k places and w width of int type
defabc <- (x << k) | (x >> (w-k)), ..
2.
left_xorshift(x, k) := x ^= x << k (left xor shift)
right_xorshift(x, k ) x ^= x >> k (left xor shift)
and for both left and right xorshift it holds:
xorshift(xorshift(x,k),k) = xorshift(x,2k)
xorshift(x,2^q * k) = x

# w is width of integer x
def inv_leftxorshift(x: int, k: int, w: int) -> int:
  k_step = k
  while (k < w):
    x ^= x << k_step
    k_step *= 2

and right shift has with orthogonal logic.
