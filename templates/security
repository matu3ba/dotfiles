Pile of monitoring tools

basics https://phoenixnap.com/kb/server-security-tips

1. wireguard + ssh (on another port)
  * (dynamic) port forwarding and all those things
  * TODO
2. sandboxed environment (jails, zones, containers)
  * whitelist of Kernel calls
  * file system overlay
  * ulimit or cgroups pendant
  * apparmor
  * landlock
  * network access removed
  * cpu, io, memory limits
  * max. execution time
  * no clipboard etc
  * no login manager entry
3. unprivileged user
4. coredump + stack trace obtainable,
5. reaper pid to kill child processes
6. restricting ptrace to only 1 process required selinux policy
https://serverfault.com/questions/933205/selinux-policy-for-cap-sys-ptrace-by-invoking-process-name,
but should work now in landlock:
https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#ptrace-restrictions
"To be allowed to use ptrace(2) and related syscalls on a target
process, a sandboxed process should have a subset of the target process rules,
which means the tracee must be in a sub-domain of the tracer."
Unfortunately it does not say "must have".
7. TODO
