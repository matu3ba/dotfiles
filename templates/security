====methods
to ensure security based on "How to Secure Existing C and C++ Software without Memory Safety" by Erlingsson
- hardware instructions for tag manipulation (for stack and heap tagging)
- formal verification of possible run-time code according to model
- platform security/integrity checks
- stack integrity
  - to prevent args, vars, return sites of fns (using cfi) cannot be changed
- control-flow integrity (cfi)
  - to ensure fn call site will only direct execution to
  start of compatible fn (type signature or (virt) member fn of class matching source code
  of call site)
- heap data integrity
  - stack and heap tagging
  - additional partitioning for isolation of heap fragments
- pointer integrity and unforgeability
  - make C/C++ pointers more similar to true capabilities (unforgeable and unguessable)
  => randomly-generated secrets
  => randomizing memory layout
  => does not discuss why (not) true capabilities (in numbers)

====basics

Micro-Kernel: Nothing enabled on default with user needing to setup things.
Mono/Uni-Kernel: Most things enabled on default with user needing to disable things.
Design of Uni-Kernel alone makes less unsecure due to less isolation of components.

Note: Linux is becoming more Micro-Kernel-like with io_uring as 0-copy messaging,
bpf as VM running statically compiled code inside Linux etc.
RFC 9669 BPF Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Proof code effort is quadratic to code size:
* Bug hidden for any non-trivial or verified implementation.
* Use the simplest approach possible, isolate components
* If unfeasible to rule out intruders, you must monitor and mitigate including
  all related costs.
* Plan for the worst case

=> seL4 would be ideal to use, but maybe there is a tradeoff to allow some
more monitoring or control on the host system ie to debug the VM?
=> Push-Button (SMT) technique:
   * specify correctness condition
   * state exploration tool
   * only proves simple properties
=> Model checking
   * simple model of system for exhaustively search state space,
   * more limited than SMT
=> Framework Microkit for minimal abstractions => Lions OS (optimized for 1 specific use case)
=> Pancake used in seL4, which is the imperative part of CakeML.
   * C-like but safer
   * written in CakeML
Unclear: Verification of linker + linker speak (object format)?

Timing channels in protocols are a huge problem
* using wireguard instead of openVPN to run ssh over it does not eliminate the
  timing channel
* must analyze frequencies, meaning plot a few dimensions against time, like
  packet size, length on router level for whatever tool you are suspicious off.
* Interact and try to identify differences (patterns etc).

idea examples or tools to for time analysis (io, network etc)

====models

* Biba
* Clark-Wilson
* Brewer-Nash

====general
Incomplete list of intrusion prevention and detection:
* login policy
* least privilege (network services non-privileged)
* chroot jails or containers for network services
* secured web content, encrypted authentication etc
* fast patching
* SELinux or Apparmor in enforcing mode
* Tripwire or other intrusion detection software and schemes to detect changes to critical files.
* rootkit detection scanners periodically
* strict firewall rules, port forwarding etc
* correct file permissions
* secure backup copies of system software and data
  for example using https://www.tarsnap.com/index.html
* sys bootstrapping from local storage until hardening applied
* write down attack vectors and plan etc

* zygote for fork server forwarding or in-place (posixy spawn) spawn
* fork server missing in firefox

====applied_basics

basics https://phoenixnap.com/kb/server-security-tips

====jail

Linux
1. wireguard + ssh (on another port)
  * (dynamic) port forwarding and all those things
2. sandboxed environment (jails, zones, containers)
  * seccomp (whitelist of Kernel calls)
  * file system overlay
  * ulimit or cgroups pendant
  * landlock (Kernel object access)
  * network access removed (routing, connection interfaces etc)
  * cpu, io, memory limits
  * max. execution time
  * no clipboard access etc
  * no login manager entry
  * cgroups, apparmor, selinux needed?
  * paging (disable Kernel Samepage Merging)
  * Kernel config https://www.timesys.com/security/securing-your-linux-configuration-kernel-hardening/
3. unprivileged user
4. coredump + stack trace obtainable,
5. reaper pid to kill child processes
6. restricting ptrace to only 1 process required selinux policy
https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-notebook
- unclear security integrity checks in overview
https://serverfault.com/questions/933205/selinux-policy-for-cap-sys-ptrace-by-invoking-process-name,
but should work now in landlock:
https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html#ptrace-restrictions
"To be allowed to use ptrace(2) and related syscalls on a target
process, a sandboxed process should have a subset of the target process rules,
which means the tracee must be in a sub-domain of the tracer."
Unfortunately it does not say "must have".
7. disable hyperthreading (in bios)
8. hardened kernel?
9. good practical usage https://blog.emilua.org/2025/01/12/software-sandboxing-basics/

====virtualization

Note: Without kvm qemu is very slow and with kvm qemu has a huge attack surface
from the guest OS.

* qemu qmp (or use qemus gdb stub) to read the vm's memory
* attach serial channel to qemu machine and write stuff to that (treat the read bytes as plain and potentially malicious data)

====allocators

Preventing Use-After-Free Attacks with Fast Forward Allocation
* overhead in runtime perf vs glibc
  + allegedly ~2.3% for one-time allocations
  + up to 35% due to mmap-sem lock in Linux kernel
  + ~60% memory overhead
  + nginx testing with comparable throughput
* lesson: One-time-allocation effective + simple to implement

====html
* could use HTTP/1.1, mandate pipelining and TLS 1.2 to get most advantages without the drawbacks
* multiplexing bad idea unless server has logic for fair scheduling (usually has not) and opens door for denial of service
* too complex, useless freedom of choice
* HTTP/1.1 drawbacks from https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-does-http-2-work/
  - head of line blocking, solution: server implements pipelining, bad: rely on time behavior (better protocols exist)
  - congestion window adjusting for handling many domains, solution: do scheduling yourself, bad: externalize as attack vector
  - header data duplication due to being stateless, solution: better defaults, bad: save more state for compression
  - there is no formal model (state automaton) of HTTP2.0, not even from the client

====virtual_machine
Windows User Space Emulator - https://github.com/momo5502/emulator/

====state_stateless_splitting
* handling non-software state
  - hardware (for drivers etc)
* stateful components
  - reset communication channels
  - restarting component
* stateless components
* No crash if, 1. no need, failure not caused 2. by component state (hw) or 3.
  erroneous state (correct states causes fault), 4. critical state, 5.
  erroneous state persistent
* persistent failures (heuristics): restart count, increase restart domain, sanitise
  persistent state, reinstall, revert, update component code, give up

====hardware_attack
- channel https://www.youtube.com/@stacksmashing
- Breaking Bitlocker - Bypassing the Windows Disk Encryption
  https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/dram-emfi.html
  * with soldering a fire lighter is sufficient to get root
  * unclear how ECC affects this
- https://www.hertzbleed.com/
  * 1 frequency side-channel leakage is problem
  * 2 even without 1: hardware-guided scheduling due to Intel Thread Director
    "Scheduled Disclosure: Turning Power Into Timing Without Frequency Scaling"
    creates variations in the number of active cores—that can be observed via remote-timing analysis
    + mitigations must consider all sources of remote power side-channel leakage
    + AMD: masking, hiding or key-rotation
    + ARM: flag DIT accessible by non-privileged code (query for support via march, os, hwcaps, emulated id registers)
    => CPU vendors must provide hardware support to eliminate timing channels
      o it remains unclear if cache behavior based attacks are feasible or only
      "CPU timing affected ones" are sufficient and/or how invasive such support
      would be for the hardware
      o compiler: mark code to adjust data-dependent CPU optimizations
      o CPU: use either 1 opcode prefix, 2 RFLAGS bit or 3 MXCSR or 4 new register
      BUT: dont use MSR only accessible by privileged code?
      HOWEVER: might be high-overhead if CPU conditions various predictors on it (has to flush them)
      SO: best to keep the flag with the data; give each register extra bit (on whether it is sensitive)
      data-dependent-timing op cant leak until data available on it (exactly when ALU finds that data is sensitive), so
      no pipeline stalls
- Intel "Data Operand Independent Timing Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Guidance" bad
  * Almost anything is better than MSR only accessible to privileged code
  * compiler to mark code that should permit data-dependent CPU optimizations differently from code that should not

====encryption
* authentication/trust usability only given with
  + SCRAM (only protects you for the 2nd-nth connections, the password still needs to be provided the first time)
  + main alternative is to use an out of band channel to communicate trust, for example
    OTP with ideally OCRA or TOTP or HOTP or something given by humans

====hashing
https://orlp.net/blog/breaking-hash-functions/
breaking hashing
* for universal hashing it was proven that it can not be broken with inversion
* Pre-image resistance. For some constant cc it should be hard to find some input mm such that h(m)=ch(m)=c.
* Second pre-image resistance. For some input m_1 it should be hard to find another input m_2 such that h(m_1)=h(m_2).
* Collision resistance. It should be hard to find inputs m_1,m_2 such that h(m_1)=h(m_2).
* Inversion
  o x += y => x -= y
  o x *= c => (modular multiplicate inverse of C) c * c^{-1} = 1 (mod m)
def egcd(a, b):
    if a == 0: return (b, 0, 1)
    g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)
    return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)
def modinv(c, m):
    g, x, y = egcd(c, m)
    assert g == 1, "c, m must be coprime"
    return x % m
  o x ^= y => x ^= y
  o bit shift can not be inverted (easily) unless 1. bit rotation by const, 2. "xorshift"
1.
abcdef -> (x >> k) | (x << (w-k)), k places and w width of int type
defabc <- (x << k) | (x >> (w-k)), ..
2.
left_xorshift(x, k) := x ^= x << k (left xor shift)
right_xorshift(x, k ) x ^= x >> k (left xor shift)
and for both left and right xorshift it holds:
xorshift(xorshift(x,k),k) = xorshift(x,2k)
xorshift(x,2^q * k) = x

# w is width of integer x
def inv_leftxorshift(x: int, k: int, w: int) -> int:
  k_step = k
  while (k < w):
    x ^= x << k_step
    k_step *= 2

and right shift has with orthogonal logic.

* https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native has
* valgrind should have options to do that
functional correct code without constant time guarantees open research problem
* At LLVM IR level this is possible with https://github.com/Neo-Outis/CT-LLVM-Artifact
* List of tools for checking constant time properties: https://crocs-muni.github.io/ct-tools/
* current
  - side channel: any observable behavior leading to information leakage
    * cause: different visible behavior on different inputs
    * early detection: timing/power consumption simulation, placement analysis,
      fault-injection/condition simulations
    * best practice defense: compute all, choose one; introduce noise;
      isolate device; reset on anomalies
  - optical/accustic/fault-behavior/electromagnetic side-channels
    * physical attack prevention need special casing and/or observation with full reset
  - (access/computing) delay side-channels
    * port,branch,mis-speculation,cache-line, other resource access delay
    * CPU identification via cpuid, valid instruction identification
    * CPU security bug in internal resource handling (often speculation related)
  - frequency/power/thermal (timing)-side channels
    * frequency-throttling side channel guidance (Kernel may break things here)
    * read power/frequency/temperature of CPU/other computing component
  - ARM with DIT and no specific instructions, Intel with DOIT and instruction list
    * disables speculative prefetching, ie for pointer chasing
    * constant time load/store (without latencies)
  - "Constant-Time Code: The Pessimist Case"
    > "In the presence of a virtual machine or an in-silicon JIT compiler, all these constant-time guarantees disappear."
  - OpenSSL Conference 2025 - Daniel J. Bernstein - Fast, Constant-Time, Correct: Pick Three
    * https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native and https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum considered state of art
    * unfortunately nothing on formalizing platform requirements
* future
  - math on system side done "System-level Non-interference for Constant-time Cryptography"
    * work needed by cryptographers to model necessary system guarantees against time and other side channels
    * work needed by Kernel/OS communities to ensure such guarantees
  - compiler side is currently being worked on (LLVM)
  - ISA/hardware extension/special hardware needed
    * BLACKOUT : Data-Oblivious Computation with Blinded Capabilities
      - address both memory-safety and timing side-channel resistance via
      1. data-oblivious programming via blinding based on ISA (blinded capabilities)
      2. "memory-safe hardware"/CHERI
      - however, no formal proof of elimination of timing side-channels or what would be needed
      - hw enforces blinded data can not be stored using non-BCs, capabilities can not be blinded
      - sw enforces bounds of valid BCs and non-BCs must not overlap (compiler + heap allocator)
      - for example eliminates Spectre
      - from my understanding this should also eliminate cache attacks
    * External IO/bus behavior could be another time-channel of Kernels (whitelist and traffic based timing attack)
    * instructions guarantees xor (spatial or temporal separation meaning on different die or location independent) needed
    * cache effects completely unclear
      + If cache effects will become practical relevant (as well): Evicting cache with
      running memory bound computation + parallel crypto on same CPU sounds like
      unfeasible perf loss. If Apple perf with offloading crypto to a separate
      "secure core" is good enough, then I think that will become the standard
      solution.
    * CHERI
      The biggest downside so far looks to be for CHERI capability reclamation
      https://lwn.net/Articles/1039851/, which sounds to me like it rules out any
      close to real-time=low latency workloads and probably high performance ones
      without (hw-guided?) optimization control on reclamation and/or hybrid mode for
      those use cases. sel4 experiments should be conclusive on this hopefully
      soonish. Funnily enough author looks like he sketches the fil-c capability
      model (without hw-based spatial/temporal security by attacker controller
      assembly on memory stuff including speculation safety/security).
      > "I know that double indirection is significantly more expensive than single
        indirection... but sweeping address space not only seems like it should be
        similarly expensive, it gets slower the more memory we allocate (whereas
        double indirection is a fixed cost per dereference)."
  - Differential fault analysis attacks/introducing faults, for example via Rowhammer remain problematic
  - Other timing attacks:
    * network: whitelist and traffic based timing attacks depend on involved systems with data patterns
    * Resource usage (patterns) "Private resource allocators and their applications"
  - Data remanence
    * Deletion by overwritng data costly, so only mark data as deleted etc
  - Physical attacks
    * Eletromagnetic waves, power measurements, optical, etc
