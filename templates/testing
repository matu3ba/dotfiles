ideas for the ideal cli test system for non-timing and timing based testing:

- design rules to distinguish observable behavior without timing from
  timing-related behavior and how to work around that
- design rules for making a multi-threaded/process tool (piecewise) deterministically
  to write test queries for the collected data of the behavior
- test system for multi-threaded/process time based test collection and human output

- Query system options for test behavior: You are basically writing a RAM database
  best TODO intro
- Make it stupidly simple.
