iterative EGCD algorithm implemented in egcd.zig correctly computes the GCD and Bezout coefficients for all inputs.

"Comparison of Two Theorem Provers: Isabelle/HOL and Coq"

According to my understanding relevant are Coq and Isabelle for formal
verification of code and Lean is not tailored to that domain and offers no
tooling for it. The best comparison I've found so far between Coq and Isabelle
is "Comparison of Two Theorem Provers: Isabelle/HOL and Coq" by Yushkovskiy. To
me the biggest difference between Isabelle and Coq sounds like that the
implementation of Coq is less trustworthy: From "Correct and Complete Type
Checking and Certified Erasure for Coq, in Coq" by Sozeau et al "Therefore, on
average, one critical bug has been found every year in Coq."
