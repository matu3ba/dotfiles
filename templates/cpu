CPU functionality and assembly below caches

#### CPU functionality
- AMD Zen dont have a single physical location where each register lives
- AMD Zen use a Register File (RF) and a Register Allocation Table (RAT)
- during vzeroupper the zero bit is set, but rolled back on branch-misprediction causing use-after-free
- RF is shared by everything on the same physical core (including hyperthreads)

Good fuzzing techniques based on https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html:
- performance counters
- reverse execution
- oracles from test CPU, ie within simulator
- reset instruction level parallelism
- generate random program and automatically transform it into a serialized one:
```asm
movnti [rbp+0x0],ebx  movnti [rbp+0x0],ebx
                      sfence
rcr dh,1              rcr dh,1
                      lfence
sub r10, rax          sub r10, rax
                      mfence
rol rbx, cl           rol rbx, cl
                      nop
xor edi,[rbp-0x57]    xor edi,[rbp-0x57]
```
