regular diff:
diffutils: diff
git: git diff

small arbitrary diffs:
diffoscope

simple binary diff:
https://superuser.com/questions/125376/how-do-i-compare-binary-files-in-linux
(can not be aborted)
diff --color -y <(xxd foo1.bin) <(xxd foo2.bin)

better binary diff:
radare2: radiff2
https://github.com/radareorg/radare2

excellent binary diff:
IDA+money, if no x86 or no cloud: diaphora

small but nice:
1. compare size
2. diff
3. compare list of sections
4. for each section compare the section content
5. optionally print the section
