processes:
* business
* product
* ops/internal

teams may be responsible horizontal or vertical
* vertical means business<->product<->ops focus (allrounder)
  - keep system tight to business requirements, eliminates overhead for team
  - less centralized power
  - pushing changes like restructuring becomes harder
  - much more negotiation over money chains/sharing maintenance
  - less to no independence of product+internal personal from business
    => pushing company-wide changes as single-person/mini team independent of
    business much more efficient
* horizontal means on ops/internal|product|business level
  - more independence from business may lead to more trying out ideas and sharing
  - centralized power simplifies keeping overviews
  - pushing changes like restructuring are simplified
  - less negotiation over money chains/sharing maintenance
  - more independence of product+internal personal from business
    => pushing company-wide changes as single-person/mini team independent of
    business much more efficient


CI/CD, shipping, debugging mandates often end-to-end control over product, so
dedicated Ops has often restricted tasks or is non-existent/external (sole
admin role becomes more and more rare).

* product<->ops/internal restrictions often creates significant unnecessary burdens
* business<->product restrictions can shield IP and increase company negotiation
  power, but often lowers understanding of business side of product

* Identifying goals
  - quantify current status with example numbers (metrics)
  - quantify wanted state with example numbers (metrics)
  - collect opinions of devs, support, testing of current product (user experience)
  - collect opinions of devs, support, testing of best practice product (user experience)

* Iterative Workflow and (path) dependency modeling
  - clarify possible responsibilities by experience
  - write down SMART goals of team with necessary SMART steps
  - identify least effort biggest gain, strategy goals, make model with (path)
    dependencies
  - make tickets with (path) dependencies; focus on a few big things per person
    and small things + clarify actual responsibilities by experience
  - iterate
