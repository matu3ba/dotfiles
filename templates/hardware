====general

* avoid or mitigate Common-Mode Noise (CMN) / Gleichtaktstörung
  + measurable +SRC or -SRC against GND
  + can be up to ~100V AC CMR for 12V USB laptop charger
  + workarounds:
    - use power supply without CMR
    - always measure before usage
    - connect -SRC of power supply with GND / ref GND of power supply with GND,
    either with capacitor or direct connection
      o connect with for example power supply, power socket etc
  + problematic with laptops, no problem with grounded desktop pc
  + correct hardware design more complex/expensive, simpler to provide GND

====computing
classical CPUs are hardware based instruction interpreters

====debugging
- protect data transmission of unshielded cables
  * use at least CRC
  * certificate authorities will test for correct error behavior
  * check the regulatory standards and laws

- parallel IO Ports, parallel input ports, parallel output ports
  * architecture vendor does not specify "how parallel data is received or send",
    but may limit it via cache misses, interrupts etc
  * board/peripherals vendor specifies
  * can be very limiting and fundamental bottleneck
  * writes may be blocking and thus insufficient for time-deterministic use cases
  * see also "Parallel Input/Output", "ARM Cortex M7 parallel io ports"
  * fully parallel and deterministic IO throughput usually means "uses a PIC"
    - PIC known to have best peripherals support from microcontrollers

- debugging capabilities of host and target system often not exemplified
  * tooling takes effort to produce and maintain
  * custom logic often IP, so vendors may prefer to not give out information
    unless via sold debugging tooling

Security Level (SL)
Safety Integrity Level (SIL)
Common Criteria with Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL)

Risk cube
* x probability and/or frequence of failure
* y severity of consequence
* z probability and/or frequency of dangerous event
Then one can specify
* SIL specifies xy relation (failure x severity)
* EAL specifies yz relation (severity x dangerous event)
* risk class specifies xz relation (failure x dangerous event)
to decide tradeoffs.

"What’s Security Level got to do with Safety Integrity Level?" by Jens Braband
SL expands CIA (data confidentiality, integrity, availability) into
1. identification and authentication control (IAC)
2. use control (UC)
3. system integrity (SI)
4. data confidentiality (DC)
5. restricted data flow (RDF)
6. timely response to events (TRE)
7. resource availability (RA)
with integrity being IAC, UC, SI, and TRE; availability being RA and
confidentiality being DC and RDF with each area getting a value of 1 to 4
to form a vector.
SL1 Protection against casual or coincidental violation
SL2 Protection against intentional violation using simple means with few resources, generic skills and a low degree of motivation
SL3 Protection against intentional violation using sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS-specific skills and a moderate degree of motivation
SL4 Protection against intentional violation using sophisticated means with extended resources, IACS-specific skills and a high degree of motivation
It is recommended to always have SL1 for safety-related systems.

The Security Assurance Level SAL is specified in a similar way as SIL.

- practical Safety Integrity Level 4 (SIL4) systems
  * Azure RTOS
- practical EAL7 systems
  * SeL4

Generally, EAL means how correct the code can be relied on to handle faults/hazardous events.
Similarly, SIL means how reliable the functionality can avert the worst specific consequences.
The risk class(es) combine(s) different severities of dangerous events.

https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/schematic-review-checklist
As software engineer you must ensure the device is sufficiently correct to diagnose
1. hardware and 2. software problems to reduce risk and costs.
This requires eliminating fatal device failure classes like
- 0. flash and reset strategy: ensure you can not hard brick the device by accident
- 1. brown-out loops: low battery with low voltage cutoff shuts down device
- 2. reset by power drain: correct watchdog(s) functionality on hardware and software
- 3. missing I2C reset: resetting individual devices to work around hardware and software issues
- 4. missing or unreadable GPIO maps/peripherals: unclear peripherals lead to
  bugs like (old) hardware versions being wrongly connected with superflous oscillosope usage etc
- 5. missing strategy for debugging in the field: JTAG and alike are nice, but often useless in field
  and reproducing locally is often very hard without data. No JTAG can be painful, when local performance
  is essential

Power/Battery
    * shutdown precedur of batter powered device?
    * battery powered: firmware knows power level and to what accuracy (needed)?
    * how does user reset device?
GPIOs
    * GPIO map in spreadsheet, main fn after reset, intended fn, additional noes
    * Microcontroller Unit (MCU) peripherals used only once?
    * MCU in reset, are peripheral devices held in proper state? (pullup/down etc)
    * reset line with proper pullup/down
    * debug GPIO used only for debug purpose?
Busses
    * (if necessary) mechanism to reset IC's attached to bus avaiable?
    * all I2C devices on same bus or different addresses?
    * MCU reset in middle of I2C read, how does recovering to talk again to other I2C device work?
    * MCU reset in SPI transfer, how does receiver handle that?
    * UART devices: Rx/Tx setup correct?
    * UART devices: RTS/CTS lines needed?
    * UART devices: RTS/CTS lines setup correctly? (some devices have not RTS -> CTS)
Memory/Flash Storage
    * code size estimate? RAM estimate? how much buffer if estimate is low?
    * sufficient space for more features over lifetime of product?
    * crash logs storage? (usually need to survive system reset)
Debug/Test Infra
    * how firmware engineer attaches debugger to board? soldering usually bad answer
    * non-essential helpful GPIOs exposed for debugger (ie SWO or ETM)?
    * existing test points for power rails, analog signals, busses?

====tooling
