- protect data transmission of unshielded cables
  * use at least CRC
  * certificate authorities will test for correct error behavior
  * check the regulatory standards and laws

- parallel IO Ports, parallel input ports, parallel output ports
  * architecture vendor does not specify "how parallel data is received or send",
    but may limit it via cache misses, interrupts etc
  * board/peripherals vendor specifies
  * can be very limiting and fundamental bottleneck
  * writes may be blocking and thus insufficient for time-deterministic use cases
  * see also "Parallel Input/Output", "ARM Cortex M7 parallel io ports"
  * fully parallel and deterministic IO throughput usually means "uses a PIC"
    - PIC known to have best peripherals support from microcontrollers

- debugging capabilities of host and target system often not exemplified
  * tooling takes effort to produce and maintain
  * custom logic often IP, so vendors may prefer to not give out information
    unless via sold debugging tooling

- practical Safety Integrity Level 4 (SIL4) systems
  * Azure RTOS
  * Does SeL4 have any widely used OS components to become SIL4?
  * Is SIL4 even a goal for SeL4?
