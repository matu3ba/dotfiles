- protect data transmission of unshielded cables
  * use at least CRC
  * certificate authorities will test for correct error behavior
  * check the regulatory standards and laws

- parallel IO Ports, parallel input ports, parallel output ports
  * does not specify "how parallel data is received or send"
  * board/CPU vendor specified
  * often very limited and the fundamental bottleneck
  * may be blocking and thus insufficient for time-deterministic use cases
  * see also "Parallel Input/Output", "ARM Cortex M7 parallel io ports"
  * fully parallel IO usually means "uses a PIC"

- debugging capabilities of host and target system often not exemplified
  * tooling takes effort to produce and maintain
  * custom logic often IP, so vendors may prefer to not give out information
    unless via sold debugging tooling
