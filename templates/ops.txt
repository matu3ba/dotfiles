Personally I'd phrase Xops as acronym for common and internal IT processes with
fancy and very overloaded descriptions usually presented without best practices.

====technical_ops
Operations usually means "internal tasks"/invisible tasks. Internal tools and
infrastructure are not visible to the customer, but products, sales, service/support,
marketing are and thus not part of "Ops".
The phrase ops is usually only used in IT contexts, since for example verification
engineers of CPUs are internal but usually not called like that and likewise QA
in manufacturing companies.

General ones are
* 1 SysOps(admins) aka systems maintenance (updates, supervision, on-call standby, sys debug tooling)
* 2 DevOps(devs) aka systems creation (design, creation, app debug tooling, less maintenance)

However, separation between 1+2 makes often no sense, because
1 administration mandates automation including integration of debug tooling and
2 permission delegation for subsystems for debugging is often required or results
  in hard block of development progress and unnecessary slow information sharing.

In practice devs 1 must be establish trust xor 2 they must demonstrate necessity
for access and 3 must be no strong incentives to block access by admins (possibly
handled via management, ideally via shared team responsibilities) if the deployment
is product related, under control and dev responsible for product.
The alternate path of the admin holds for code access from the admin perspective
to have an overview on current and future demands for task prioritization via
understanding of the existing workflows.
* realistically this only happens in small or shared teams or if devs=admins

Hereby IP security, security and trust must be weighed to mitigate information
islands forming preventing a coherent system overview and vision.
* there are various ways to do this depending on company culture

Ideally, each team provides
* 1 system + debugging + infra overview
* 2 system vision
* 3 use case group overview
* 4 design with trade-offs
* 5 devops cycle (building, testing, deploying) workflow guidelines for fast
  onboarding, deep dives and collaboration (assuming testing includes
  end-to-end testing and deployments).

====Documentation
from higher to lower priority:
* Provide overviews on relevant teams, projects with individual system overview infos.
  - see section technical_ops
* Frequent copy-paste dev operations belong into git next to code, complex ones
  into links (to wiki).
* Keep relevant parts structured, up to date and add explicit notes (when
  something smells wrong).
* Do not keep the same data in 2 places, unless important to keep context.
* Wiki: Keep it as short as reasonable for usage, strive for seperation into
  high-quality workflow guidelines, reference manual info, contextual notes.
  Do not create tutorials, they tend to be low-quality workflow guidelines.
* Prefer quality over quantity for workflow guidelines and keep amount reasonable.
  - Simple or less important things do not need a workflow guideline.
* Prefer fast/automation instructions of workflows (scripts, shortcuts, etc)
  with corresponding path notations (in case of menus) over screenshots.
  - Screenshots take more time and may not be needed.

====CI_CD_goals
from higher to lower priority:
* use real or close to real data (customer/product)
* make deployments, rollbacks data available in a centralized place and allow
  simple to setup reasonably reproducible systems
  - keep CI as close to dev setup as reasonably possible
* version everything, if reasonably possible - especially code and data - and
  automate system data retrieval if reasonable
  - keep data on stable branches with related data for code and data bisecting, searches
* automate everything, especially testing, integration, deployment/release
  - offer reasonable control over the process for full/semi-automatic deployments
  and debugging (bisecting etc)

====buzzwords
Specialized ones being combination or (extension with) focus on specific fields
or activities are
* AIOps (AI related)
* BizDevOps (management/CEO for business+other in loop based on metrics)
  - sounds ideal for non-hw products, but very unclear user experience concept
    and consequences
* CloudOps (cloud related)
* DataOps (data related)
* DevSecOps (system security [of dev+management])
* FinOps (accounting system for cloud)
* GitOps (git tracking of of infra, mrs, ci/cd)
* MLOps (ML+data eng+DevOps)
* ModelOps (dev+sys for AI workflows)
* NetDevOps (networking + devops, background SDN for WAN)
* NoOps (buzzword for ideal operation state as goal)
* SecDevOps (prio on security over DevSecOps)
* TwinOps (dev+sys for digital twin model)
The buzzwords, like "DevOps" are acronyms.
