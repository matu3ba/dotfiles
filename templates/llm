* sumarizing
  - parameters from training material
    o subject is well-represented by the parameters => parameters dominate the
    summary more and the actual text you want to summarise influences the summary
    less
    o bad in making specific summaries of a subject that is widespread
  - context (prompts and answers until now in chat) including the text given to summarise
    o context very small => little influence, so result dominated by parameters
    o context large enough and subject not well-represented by params =>
    text to summarize dominates results resulting in "text shortening", not
    true summarizing
  - no intelligence involved, query machine with context for processing
