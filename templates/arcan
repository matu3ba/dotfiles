a12 cell is 6-10 times than ascii character
scollback is however on source system, not remote

* outermost one takes on the responsibilities of window management and display control, becoming the ‘desktop’
* Document browsing is compilation step through separate tools that generates a signed, shareable application package.
* recursive (app can embed others including itself) and compose + interact with allow-listed local sw
* Media decoding, media transforms, network communication and system
  integration are all delegated to per-instance sets of interchangeable
  privilege-separated programs.
=> essentially a browser take on a microkernel architecture

====requirements
* permissions to access /dev/dri/*
* permissions to access input device nodes
* usually need to be in input, graphics, render groups

====source_deps
sqlite3, openal-soft, sdl2, opengl, luajit, gbm, kms, freetype, harfbuzz, libxkbcommon
libvlc-core, ffmpeg suite, leptonica, tesseract (ocr), libvncserver libusb1, v4l2-loopback, mupdf
xcb-util-devel imagemagick-devel file-devel

on chimera:
* apk add sqlite-devel openal-soft-devel sdl2-devel mesa-devel luajit-devel
* apk add mesa-gbm-devel freetype-devel harfbuzz-devel libxkbcommon-devel
* apk add ffmpeg-devel leptonica-devel tesseract-devel
* apk add libvncserver-devel libusb-devel v4l2loopback-devel
TODO package libvlc-core
missing: apk add kms?? libvlc-core?? v4l2loopback-devel mupdf??

Keyboard setup can be very annoying. Especially so, if browser + clipboard does
not work yet.

SHENNANIGAN
Guide with examples for reading and writing config via arcan missing.

No "it just works" feeling for basic stuff (browsers, irc, discord to get help).

====FAQ
P: keyboard does not work
S: add user to input group
P: keyboard layout is wrong
S: add share/arcan/appl/durden/devmaps/keyboard/default.lua according to README.md
P: adding share/arcan/appl/durden/devmaps/keyboard/default.lua does not work, I'm on Nix.
S: Add an overlay with the files patched:
```nix

```
P:
idea finish this
