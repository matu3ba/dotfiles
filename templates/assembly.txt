====AT&T_syntax_bad
AT & T syntax is very bad, dont use it
https://outerproduct.net/2021-02-13_att-asm.html

AT&T syntax is broken:
movl  28, %eax     ; (3) same as (2)
movl  ($28), %eax  ; (4) load one long from the memory location indicated by symbol ‘$28’ and store it in the EAX register

Suffixes are very annoying
movq    ......
movl    ......
movsbl  ......
movzbl  ......
movb    ......
movl    ......
