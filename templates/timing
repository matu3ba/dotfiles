====cycle_time
* Beckhoff devices can go down to 50us
* FGPA cycle time typically goes down to 10us, but is only constrained by hardware and clock speed (up to 1.5 GHz)
* ASIC allow more routing optimizations and only have physical constrains besides hardware (3GHz or more possible)

====latency
* wifi typically >1ms
  - Wi-Fi 6 OFDMA
    o roundtripping latency ~2-3ms with one AP, one client and no interference
    o <4ms for bidirectional VoIP
    o testing two-hop multi-AP showed 4-5ms
  - wifi 7 OFDMA
    o no numbers yet
* 5G network latency with ~100us
* cheap hardware numbers indicate >3ms https://electricui.com/blog/latency-comparison
