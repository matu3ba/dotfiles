get Kernel config
cat /proc/config.gz | gunzip > running.config

Watching based on notify events:
inotifywait -e modify,create,delete -m -r /path/to/your/dir

Trace systemcalls:
strace ./binary

Get list of open files from process
lsof

Monitor changes based on inode level (application must change directory
inode on file insertion, so one might miss events):
auditctl -w <path> -p <permissions> -k <key>
ausearch -f <path>
ausearch -k <key>
auditctl -l
auditctl -W <path>

TODO:
- bpftrace with monitoring
- if absolutely necessary bcc (painful to install)
