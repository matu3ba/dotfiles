L/L1/L2/L3: live, de Phase (conducting electricity)            [old: UVW]
N:          neutral, de Masse/Neutralleiter (no electricity)   [old: M]
PE:         protective earth, de Erde/Erdung/Schutzleiter      [old: N]
GDN/N+PE:   ground, de Null/Nullleiter                         [old: grounding symbol]
missing PE requires

====measure
* black cable for COM, red for other
* dont use any connection hole with "DC" in name for AC
different systems common:
* good GND when L-N == L-PE ,
  since N-GND == 0 with GND=N+PE
  <=> N-(N+PE) == 0 iff PE == 0
* TT-System, IT-System, TN-C-S-System (TN-C and TN-S System)

====work
laying GND cable (PE with N connected)
* when L-N != L-PE
