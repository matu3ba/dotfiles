====dataflow_systems
* aqualang as language designed to be compositional, safe, fast, easy to use
  - uses equality saturation for optimizations

====distributed_double_accounting_databases
tigerbeetle

====query_compilation
Database query compilation: our journey Thomas Neumann & Viktor Leis
* trade-offs on query execution
Simpler alternative to use REST on postgresql https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest
* likely slower, uses haskell

====relational_database
* structured query language (sql)
  - bigquery, zetasql, etc (pipe syntax for composability)
  - prql (pipelined relational query language) as "modern sql replacement" for composability
    o transforms, orthogonalisms, invariants, few primitives, fns, ergonomics
    o clickhouse, duckdb, glaredb, mysql, postgres, sqlite, ansi, bigqueue, mssql, snowflake
* performance tuning
  - reduce table size
  - simplify and omit if possible joins
  - (postgresql) to get runtime of query prefix it with EXPLAIN
  - TODO many more things

====replication
"Enough with all the Raft" by Alex Miller
* Blob Storage
* Quorum
* Raft
* Reconfiguration

====usability_shortcomings
"DB usability as if" by Jonathan Edwards
* displaying relationships
* interactive schema evolution (DSLs in research, but no interactivity)
* version control for data and schema

====vector_databases
https://grski.pl/vdb

unclear use cases of http://www.logicblox.com/learn.html

====performance
data bases restrict data flexibility (ie opc-ua) for better perf + synced storage
general rule: must measure
* ACID
* BASE/non-ACID (dont care that data is trustable) like get latest value asap
  - key/value stores 
  - time series dbs
  - TODO what more?
  - only useful in distributed cases to sidestep costly locking
  - Early Mongo was shiny JSON-shaped memcached (key-value store)
  - time spent in app: postgres: first needs deserialize db response, then deserialize jsonb seperately
