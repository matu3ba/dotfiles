====dataflow_systems
* aqualang as language designed to be compositional, safe, fast, easy to use
  - uses equality saturation for optimizations

====distributed_double_accounting_databases
tigerbeetle

====query_compilation
Database query compilation: our journey Thomas Neumann & Viktor Leis
* trade-offs on query execution

====relational_database
* structured query language (sql)
  - bigquery, zetasql, etc (pipe syntax for composability)
  - prql (pipelined relational query language) as "modern sql replacement" for composability
    o transforms, orthogonalisms, invariants, few primitives, fns, ergonomics
    o clickhouse, duckdb, glaredb, mysql, postgres, sqlite, ansi, bigqueue, mssql, snowflake

====replication
"Enough with all the Raft" by Alex Miller
* Blob Storage
* Quorum
* Raft
* Reconfiguration

====usability_shortcomings
"DB usability as if" by Jonathan Edwards
* displaying relationships
* interactive schema evolution (DSLs in research, but no interactivity)
* version control for data and schema
