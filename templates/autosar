* differences between standards?
* bus property aware wrt noise and other statistic etc?
* 1 idempotency
* 2 consistency
* 3 backpressure
* 4 observability
* 5 fault-tolerance
* 6 service discovery
* consensus, replication?
* safety, security?

Application SW Component
Interface (Sender/Receiver Port, Client/Server Port)
RTE
Basic Software

standardized interface described in .ARXML (xml-based architecture definition)
* interacts only with RTE, never with hw
* interacts with RTE to talk to other SWC
* inside SWC: ports, interfaces, runnable entities, internal behavior
* vendors for example Vector DaVinci Developer, EB tresos Studio, AUTOSAR Builder

* toolchain complexity
* steep learning curve
* highly modular design with runtime and memory cost

complex drivers
* loosely coupled with ECU hardware, but accessible to application layer
* have access to hw resources without relying heavily on standard layers
* low-level dev, custom interrupt service routines
* often highly hardware specific

* model based design relevant for safety modeling and coverage
