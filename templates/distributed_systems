* AWS
* minikube (simple test environment)
* nginx

* kafka
* prometheus
* app monitoring 4 golden signals

idea attacks and worst cases (single points of failures like bugs in tools to monitor bugs etc)
idea analysis/videos of overhead of kubernetes for understanding tradeoffs
idea analysis and debugging tools of kubernetes
minikube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBudNa-j7as

idea how much complexity one can manage on your own
idea automatic attaching a debugger for ssh into machine and attach
