Dumping preprocessor state
-d
-d<arg>
-dA
-dD
Print macro definitions in -E mode in addition to normal output
-dI
Print include directives in -E mode in addition to normal output
-dM
Print macro definitions in -E mode instead of normal output

The action to perform on the input.
-E, --preprocess
Only run the preprocessor
-S, --assemble
Only run preprocess and compilation steps
-c, --compile
Only run preprocess, compile, and assemble steps (no linking)
-emit-llvm
Use the LLVM representation for assembler and object files
-fsyntax-only
-module-file-info
Provide information about a particular module file

-v, --verbose
Show commands to run and use verbose outputverbose

Preprocessor flags
-C, --comments
Include comments in preprocessed output
-CC, --comments-in-macros
Include comments from within macros in preprocessed output

1. group -I searches together, in order as first seen on command-line
2. groups -isystem searches together as first seen on command line and in the end
3. absolute search list first searches all -I dirs, then it searches all -isystem dirs

SHENNANIGAN MAJOR FOOTGUN
When clang gets a `-isystem` dir that interferes with `-I` it silently removes
the dir from `-I` and adds it to `-isystem`, in effect demoting the search
precedence of the dir.
"If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with -isystem,
is also specified with -I, the -I option is ignored. The directory is still
searched but as a system directory at its normal position in the system include
chain."
