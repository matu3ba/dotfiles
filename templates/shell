There is a complete wiki dedicated to the weird quirks of bash:
https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/brace

SHENNANIGAN
- 1. brace expansion does only work on standalone variables:
  * "{1..3}" does not work, but {1..3} works
  * workaround for using in variables: `eval {$a..$b}`
  * workaround in for loops `for i in $(eval echo {$a..$b})`

SHENNANIGAN process spawning
- There is no standard way to signal a process is initialized to the parent process
- Shell has only quirky signaling ways: (named) pipe, (temp) file
  * Example: 'stty -F /dev/ttyS0 min 0 time 10 &' takes time to spawn
