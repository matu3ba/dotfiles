Debug Tooling
IDA Pro
- Hex-Rays decompilers

Core problem of abstraction in gdb:
- tui without any stability guarantee
- python scripting
- MI (machine interface)
  * requires parsing deeply complex and hostile data across privilege boundaries
- DAP (debugger adapter protocol)
  * usable for example in neovim

WinDbg and gdb with
- enhancement plugins such as peda pwndbg
- peda https://github.com/longld/peda
- pwndbg https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg

gdb
- posix gdb frontend https://github.com/nakst/gf

MSan, TSan
- bug discovery, crash deduplication, root cause analysis

Bochs x86 emulator
- very convenient instrumentation API, compatibility with the latest CPU
  features and ability to instrument entire operating systems

Unfortunately we have a huge pile of calling conventions=protocols in systems
in the field, which were also never designed with abi versioning in mind. And
to eliminate requires building competing platforms/protocols to replace
existing ones while being compatible for the meantime. I've never understood
why platforms with calling conventions offer no libraries to introspect
themself for user code debugging. at compiletime, runtime, linktime etc Instead
each compiler, debugger etc implements the same stuff again and again without a
reference impl
