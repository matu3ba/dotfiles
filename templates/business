Different types of Business model and tradeoffs in how to make money.
* Do It Yourself (DIY)
* Configuration As A Service (CAAS)
* Advice From Experience and Contract (AFEAC)
* idea catch phrase for hard to prove broken product domains (hardware vendors, etc)

====AFE

====CAAS
Example: Ethercat Product purpose is to have simple to extend electrical connections
with realtime characteristics in close to millisecond range down to 10-100us,
which is sufficient for many simple control applications.

However, developer experience is not great for REPL = fast debug cycles, which
may be typical or representative for "configuration as a service" products due
to incentives to not improve the build system to check validity of hardware
configurations and alike.

This includes router vendors, camera vendors etc.
