memory models
1. synchronisation of memory from parallel execution works via fences https://stackoverflow.com/a/61711095
// Software Memory Models in C++
// memory_order | fences
// relaxed      | None
// consume      | LoadLoad, LoadStore (fences only for vars that are data-dependent on that atomic)
// acquire      | LoadLoad, LoadStore
// release      | LoadStore, StoreStore
// acq_rel      | LoadLoad, LoadStore, StoreStore
// seq_cst      | All (default order)
available via atomic_var.store(true, std::memory_order_release)
=> architecture-dependent and messy (stuff like spurious wakeups exist and costs can vary significantly)

2. pointer semantics: 3 cases to handle provenance
1. known and reused (no ambiguity on usage)
2. can be derived ie from pointer casts (pick one and check, if it works)
3. unknown (external code and no encoding of IR etc)
potentially ambiguous cases
1. ptr->int->ptr cast + usage
2. int->ptr->int cast + usage
3. ptr->int union cast usage
4. int->ptr union cast usage

3. simpler things?
