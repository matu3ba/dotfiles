* hot reload https://zig.news/perky/hot-reloading-with-raylib-4bf9

====system_abi
* STATUS Huge pile of calling conventions=protocols in systems in the field
  - almost all of them never designed with abi versioning in mind
  - elimination requires building competing platforms/protocols to replace
    existing ones while being compatible for the meantime
* MISSING_PART Platforms with calling conventions offer no libraries to introspect themself
  for user code debugging at 1. compilation time, runtime, linktime etc
* RESULT Each compiler, debugger etc implements the same stuff again and again
  without a reference implementation
* HISTORY C ABI had C compiler as reference implementation
  - does not help with introspection
  - C ABI design was no priority at first
  - crufty tool to bootstrap was never improved
* THE_FIX Bootstrap improved tool back to lower level/base layer
  - make it trivial to bootstrap from and for any platform

====debugging_definition
From https://gu.outerproduct.net/debug.html
Assume: developer/user knows correct and incorrect states and the code
represents a correct model of the intended semantics.
* program as state machine (often non-deterministic)
* bug is bad transition rule
* execution witness as states and state transitions encountered on one specific
  program run
* if execution witness shows "bad state", then there must be a bug,
  - often not obvious when the state became bad like when state is subtly wrong
* debugger as query engine over states and transitions of a buggy execution witness
* most programs behave non-deterministic
* frequent operation is bug source isolation to deterministic component
  - encapsulation of non-determinism simplifies process like functional programming (isolation of all side effects)
* concurrent code tricky to debug, because one needs to trace the execution flow
  to estimate where the origin to the incorrect state is
  - time-travel debugging/deterministic replay with rr only allows stepping backwards,
    but simulates multiple processes or threads on 1 CPU core
* suspecting scalable deterministic replay with relative low time overhead
  on regular hardware via thread-locality (based on 2002 paper) without further
  examples

====library_framework
What's your imagination to what time-travel debugging can be? (Egg-laying wull
milk pig with mind-blowing complexity and scope).
* graphical + text editor with shortcuts to serialize and deserialize
  - 1. program control flow state by relative conditions to another (in what
    source file area which thread or process is)
  - 2. program state state conditions (relative or absolute program conditions)
    and ideally would generalize both to
  - 3. arbitrary programs [in which for example kernel information like memory
    usage could be queried] for all introspection use cases (debugging,
    memcheck/validators, race condition checkers, tracers) to have seperate
    overlays for debugging to reproduce the state of one program state
    condition within the other tool even under stochastic events.
* As far as I understand, currently language semantics leak into debuggers
  besides debuggers/systems with repls can not be designed well for third party
  interactivity, which is why gdb and lldb do not expose pretty printer as c
  api or formatting library etc.
* More ideally, the semantics of the program itself could be reasoned
  about, but this would require compiler support with complete enough memory
  models + simulator with debug api etc on top of that (say Miri or Cerberus)
  to initialize the simulator from arbitrary program state.
* As of now, we neither have a cross-usable snapshotformat for programs (on
  the same platform) nor tooling to compare program states or traces.
* Further, debug system scripting experience is very bad
  + non-portable
  + natvis (must create bindings), python/javascript (no underlying type info)
* Kernel mode debug traces are not supported (unfeasible to support in general),
  think of combined user land kernel land trace across processes

====interested_discussion
* Lauterbach or ericsson context may be most advanced regarding debugging techniques
* ui missing and classes of problems to debug
  - problem source classification for debugging
  - examples: missing session stuff, cerberus/miri/more concrete tooling and user annotation (program invariants, filters and stuff like that)
  - comparing continuations mandates something like miri/cerberus or an equivalent with more optimizations for threading problems.
  - not sure if bmc of cerberus does that.
  - only having queries is not powerful enough to trace down things. in the end you have to write something like implicit CTL formulae
  to reduce debugger interactions.
    + capturing or checking state may introduce or prevent detecting errorneous behavior
* recording traces of multiple runs of same program into queryable database could already open new interesting ways of debugging
  - see above portable format for comparing tools and reexecute at individual timepoints (known to reproduce a buggy state)
  - so far only done via coverage analysis and other statistical tools
  - combine such trace db with fuzzer as state space crawler and you get powerful insights on execution
  - digging down one trace hard to extrapolate and imagine causality for certain states
  - uncertain how to combine information from traces, meaning what queries one can make against this info
  - dynamic trace db would be useful for fuzzer itself, to find unexplored states
    + probably means that this is already being done by antithesis for example
  - equivalent state collapse
    + see above user annotations as runtime checks for beahvior + efficient subset of CTL+ formulae
    + dependency graph construction, view, annotations over states etc to solve questions like
      "what state lead to this state"? "what states this state can evolve to?" "what transitions could lead to this state?"
* 'semantic dependency'/sdep relation
* dynamic hash-cons. union-find -> eventually coherent
  - tricky when you have state which is somehow parametric but uniform in structure—have
    to pick the right representation to be able to compress it properly
* better framework, better defaults
  - debugger for avoiding harness and a better starting state
  - reverse execution for reducing startup costs
  - coverage guided fuzzing as default
  - symbolic execution to generate better inputs
  - arcan appl for simluating interaction
  - basic triage then into a12+cat9 for interacting with unique triaged source
  - senseye for comparing more subtle data corruption (packets in packets, string injections, ...)
* debugging as process to learn memory relations and runtime context relations (t1 does x while t2 does y)
  - one of the simplest initial steps is to add invariants to the program for synchronization stuff.
  - very often removing program parts is no option due to weird dependencies and effects on timing behavior etc.
  - Sampling another method, if the problem is less time and more arithmetic/offset related or stochastic.

* store trace information for any tracing levels
  - instruction tracing
  - function tracing
  - library/service interface level tracing
  - service to service tracing,
  - machine to machine tracing
  - https://www.philipzucker.com/hashing-modulo/ egraphs-style heavy hammer 'represent the big thing in compressed form'
  - another option is sometimes available 'compress by construction' which is nicer when it works
* practicality/scalability (aka trace is too big/slow, does not reproduce problem etc)
  - (semi-) deterministic record+replay, because non-determinism breaks any hashtree for looking up traces
  - jitted/compiled tracing/sampling or "make things semi-deterministic" depending on use cases
  - 1. exploration requires storing as is (default/selection of trace profile what to record)
    vs 2. collecting transitions that lead to the exact same state (chopping of states)
    vs 3. higher level reasononing or larger collection of accumulated traces implies
    normalisation or other techniques mentioned in the hasing modulo theories article
* what should state be and how to model compound states like structs and arrays?
* how should non-determinism detection work?
* Debugging, like programming, has fundamental tradeoffs between determinism, performance, memory and synchronization speed/observability.
* stochastic events like race conditions depending on memory access + speed.
* rewrite binaries to trap syscalls via qemu libc + stack swapping
