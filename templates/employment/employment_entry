Good evening or morning dear colleagues,

as you may already noticed, I am a new colleague and will be.
Therefore, I'd like to do a small welcome.

Next (dayname) (date) I'll bring some small things, so far planned on (time) in break room.
For this purpose I'd like to invite all of you, as long as it does not cause any inconvenience.

Best Regards,
Jan
