Alignment to the job search method by Kirsch Mackey
* be realistic on what you can do and align your job offer as close as possible
  to the job description
* pick 3 jobs to reverse engineer craft the 3 types of recruiters
* marketing: customer has problem, needs solution

* company is entity with different problems and solutions
* 5% of those businesses are successful, less than 1% success rate
* complex set of processes to make that work
* certain problems that are so big, that they are paying lots of money per year
* real problem is costing you 5x-10x that much
* might be very specific thing they want
* marketing: speaking to the exact problem the customer has

1. use the keywords from the job description and adjust keyphrases that they
use (dont copy verbatim)
2. customer is most important
3. run the company profiles and the products that they make
* should tell you what kind of things they care about
* getting the ideal customer profile in job and business
4. innovation, unconvention, creative -> every single word here matters
5. allegro, altium, mentor graphics; researching etc; studied PCB design trends
   evaluate and implement != analyzed
7. framework of phrases you can implement each time
   use all the keywords for faster search

**software** software you used
**professional experience** for stuff you did

action task (ideally skill)
* "copy writing method with x result by y % etc"
to create resumes -> alignment
customer product yield/performance [cutting edege is wanted]

align with what they want on the phone call
dont shoot yourself in the foot: dont mention it
bring up what you have done what aligns with it
dont bullshit
if you did not read the thing, you did not read it
i started to read it

recruiters look for job descriptions of linkedin profile
* SEO optimization from 3-4 job types
* previous/current role for senior,
* why python, hardware, embedded?
recommended
hardware person etc
* idea: 20-30 recruiters doing the job for you instead of you being active

this is looking good. if this were 150k i would not leave the lab
sweeten the pot technique to get the sale to get the extra 5-10k (3-5k)
