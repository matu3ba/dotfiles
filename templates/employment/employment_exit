Good evening or morning dear colleagues,

as you may already notices, I will leave (company) until (date).
For the time together I would like to thank you.

Next (dayname) (date) I'll bring some small things, so far planned on (time) in break room.
For this purpose I'd like to invite all of you, as long as it does not cause any inconvenience.

The last (time period) (how enrichment,personal,professional development).
Thank you all for for this time and your collaboration.

The shared time, beautiful and profound conversations as well as moments will
remain in my memory.

Best Regards,
Jan
