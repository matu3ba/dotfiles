* Project F — Tutorials Vivado + Verilog https://projectf.io
* ZipCPU Blog, logic design and bus protocols https://zipcpu.com
2 Deep dive
* lean Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic (PL) interaction with Zynq
* Xilinx / AMD Blogs — Vitis, Vivado and Zynq-specific projects

  - Tutorials focused on Zynq boards https://digilent.com/blog/
3 Get comforable with key communication protocols
* UART, SPI, I2C for peripheral communication, AXI for PS-PL data exchange
* Ethernet and AXI DMA next as you advance
4 Explore real projects and community repos
