Apache log4net part of Apache Logging Services project
* Appenders
  - responsible for delivering log events to their destination
* Layouts
  - appender uses a layout to encode a LogEvent into a form that meets the
    needs of whatever will be consuming the log event
* Filters
  - Filters are log4net plugins that evaluate the parameters of a logging call
    or a log event and return one of three results
    1 ACCEPT: The filter accepts the log event. This effectively causes other
    filters in the same filtering stage to be skipped.
    2 DENY: The filter drops the log event.
    3 NEUTRAL: log4net behaves as if the filter was not present. It is
    evaluated by the next filter in the filter chain.
