The ideal solution:
- text based configuration, no graphical interface
- separation into controller and runner
- strictly typed, simplified posix shell (very portable)
  * skalib runner (the dude that made s6)?
  * zig build has no sandboxing and neither convenient path hackery + high initial delay
- authentication
- artefact caching interface
  * uri based + authentication or what is the simplest way?
- prevents writes outside the current working directory (on default)
- config changes to file require admin ok
- remote gdb

jenkins
- custom DSL requires still clicking around things
- webhooks are annoying to setup: "Generic Webhook Trigger"
- Groovy Sandbox
