The ideal solution:
- text based configuration, no graphical interface
- separation into controller and runner
- strictly typed, simplified posix shell (very portable)
  * skalib runner (the dude that made s6)?
  * zig build has no sandboxing and neither convenient path hackery + high initial delay
- authentication
- artefact caching interface
  * uri based + authentication or what is the simplest way?
- prevents writes outside the current working directory (on default)
- config changes to file require admin ok
- default logging of common paths to fast debug problems
- remote gdb
- remote ssh
- Mutual exclusive locks on pipelines (for sharing ressouces via network)
- Atomiticity of artifact cache access (per node)
- Process limitation of harware usage

=> build DSL from source + DSL has automatic sandboxing checked via Linter, such
that one only needs to review non-sandboxed parts (authentication cache etc).

jenkins
- custom DSL requires still clicking around things
- webhooks are annoying to setup: "Generic Webhook Trigger"
- Groovy Sandbox
- No support for bare checkout without repo in cwd
- No default logging of common paths for common errors (can not find groovy script)
- No model for mutual exclusive locks on pipelines
- No atomiticity of artifact cache access
- Missing process limitation of harware usage

- In Jenkinsfile, check out the main repository in the subdirectory using dir():
dir('subDir') {
    checkout scm
}
