declarative
* slint.dev
perf
* dear imgui
* do own rendering loop
simplicity
* Windows Forms

Typical requirements
* (reasonable amount of minimal) functionality
* simplicity of usage
* reasonable perf
* testability
* bonus: serialization + deserialization (server client architecture,
  simulate clients in server etc)

=> So far not found any gui toolkit offering all of it,
usually lacking in either 1. testability or 2. serialization/deserialization.

idea:
protobuf + c++ toolkit like imgui (test license should be cheap enough)
render everything in server yourself

Windows Forms easy to use, but C# requires crossing language boundaries

figma QAMl for declarative guis
